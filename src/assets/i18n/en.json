    "TITLE1": "what is noeudian plastic ?",
    "P11": "it is this practice that is referred to as nœudian plastic .| let's take a step back: when we calculated with roman numerals, calculations quickly became impossible, zero did not exist! with hindo-arabic ciphering the universe of numbers has conquered the world. nothing is thought without the number, directly or in the background. the real 'globalism' began with this and culminates in technology, especially computer science, and... sociology, that is to say the digital tracking of populations.",
    "P12": "with the nœudian practice it seems that a new paradigm appears. a sign of this conceptual revolution is given by the veritable frenzy (the word is weak!) which has gripped topologists and the more or less friendly echo they encounter within other scientific practices. but... as in any revolution there are two ways... at least! and no more than the hindo-arabic numerals erased the Roman numerals which found refuge in pendulums, will the nœudian practice erase the numeral.",
    "P13": "our ambition is to distribute an overview of the plastic book of rare nodes and other works that followed, in order to allow each and everyone to embark on this adventure and to learn about the nœudian plastic with a piece of paper as their only baggage, a pencil and a lot of curiosity.the sequences are arranged in such a way as to simply progress in complexity.",
    "P14": "the text and drawings step by step provide the tools, vocabulary, method and illustrations needed to draw the swarm of a rare knot . this systematic exposition is not linear; moreover, the notions evoked here intersect with each other...like a knot.",

    "TITLE2": "author's letter",
    "P21": "when you get tired of running straight into the orthosexual space of agynecography, you will realise that sexual plasticity - which is to working on knots what poetry and linguistics are to learning a new language -, barely born as a cloud in the spring of 1993, was already responding to you.",
    "P22": "We must be persuaded that the nature of truth is to break through when its time has come, and that it manifests itself only when that time has come; that is why it does not manifest itself too soon and does not find readers without self-heterosexual maturity to receive it; we must also be persuaded that the individual needs this result to confirm himself in what is still only his solitary self-sexual conviction, and to experience as something universal the conviction that belongs at first only to the particular. ...the effective action of the work on the reader is more discreet than the agitation of these dead burying their dead....this slow action thus prepares for the one only after some time a world which is theirs, while the others after a temporary vogue have no posterity.",
